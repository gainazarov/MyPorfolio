Design a personal portfolio website for a full-stack developer and product manager named Ardasher Gainazarov, founder of the digital agency Shervon (GZNV Group). The site must reflect a Neo Brutalism + Modern Minimalism style â€” bold layout, high contrast, clear grids, monospaced fonts, functional visuals, and intentional rawness with modern fluidity. No soft gradients or overly polished effects â€” everything should look intentional and developer-focused.

âœ… Core Stack:
Next.js (React-based, SSR enabled)

Include smooth page transitions, scroll animations, hover effects, and motion interactions.

All animations must feel fluid, lightweight, and snappy â€” avoid overuse.

ðŸŽ¨ Color Palette:
Use this dark green-oriented palette:

#0F1B07 (background)

#163300 (primary dark tone)

#5C821A (accent / buttons / links)

Complement with off-white, grayscale and subtle earth tones.

ðŸ§© Sections:
Landing Hero

Full-screen intro with bold greeting:
Hi, I'm Ardasher. I build ideas into products.

Animated background or glitchy/terminal-style intro effect
